# Lightbot
A Discord bot made in Python with discord.py, it has some inside jokes in it, but the functions and their implementations are nice for a beginner.

Contriubtors from the original private repo: 
  - [Femboyhooters-png](https://github.com/Femboyhooters-png) (Original idea of the project)
  - [E404NNF](https://github.com/e404nnf) (Worked on the config and random status)
  - [Esslam912](https://github.com/Esslam912) (Worked on Rainbow role and looped messages, doesn't have anything to do with the organization).


Any PRs to improve the quality of the code are accepted.
